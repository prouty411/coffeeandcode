# Coffee and Code

This 'hacakathon' project was built with the help of 2 other members. It is a web application that allows users to search for a study spot in any city they choose. Specifically, they have the option of choosing between cafes and libraries. 

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Google Maps API and Yelp API

## Features
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- The ability for users to search cafes/libraries in a certain city
- Error handling so that users must choose one of the 2 options
- Allows the user to decide whether they want their current location on that they can find directions to the place of their choice
- Used Yelp API to show the most pertinent information about each cafe/library to the user such as if they are currently open, price range, rating
